# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a reputable company with thousands of employees. Along with an HR analyst, I have been tasked with analyzing 6 CSV files with employee information in order to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
